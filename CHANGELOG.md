This release includes improvements to the OpenTelemetry configuration API introduced in the previous releases

- refactor: improve OpenTelemetry configuration (#127)

- fix: ensure telemetry is reported when API exceptions are raised (#127)

## v0.7.1

### [0.7.1](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1) (2024-09-16)

This release includes fixes for several bugs identified in the previous release related to OpenTelemetry metrics reporting: (#124)

- fix: attribute values are now correctly exported as their intended types (previously, these were all sent as string values)
- fix: `http_client_request_duration` being reported in seconds rather than the intended milliseconds
- fix: sync client mistakenly passing the entire configuration (rather than just the OpenTelemetry configuration as intended) to `queryDuration()` and `requestDuration()`
- fix: some attributes may not have been exported as expected under some conditions
- fix: `queryDuration()` and `requestDuration()` may not have updated their histograms reliably when `attr_http_client_request_duration` or `attr_http_server_request_duration` (respectively) were not enabled (which is the default)

Please note that if you use third-party OpenTelemetry tooling to visualize the attributes mentioned above, you may need to update your queries to account for these changes.

## v0.7.0

### [0.7.0](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0) (2024-08-30)

- feat: enhancements to OpenTelemetry support (#120)

Note this introduces some breaking changes to our metrics:

1. `fga-client.request.method` is now in TitleCase to match the naming conventions in the Protos, e.g. `Check`, `ListObjects`, etc..
2. Due to possible high costs for attributes with high cardinality, we are no longer including the following attributes by default:

- `fga-client.user`
- `http.client.request.duration`
- `http.server.request.duration`
  We added configuration options to allow you to set which specific metrics and attributes you care about in case the defaults don't work for your use-case

## v0.6.1

  Note: To use this feature, you need to be running OpenFGA v1.5.7+ with the experimental flag
  `enable-consistency-params` enabled. See the [v1.5.7 release notes](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.5.7) for details.

BREAKING CHANGES:
Note: This release comes with substantial breaking changes, especially to the interfaces due to the protobuf changes in the last release.

While the http interfaces did not break (you can still use `v0.3.3` SDK with a `v1.3.8+` server),
the grpc interface did and this caused a few changes in the interfaces of the SDK.

If you are using `OpenFgaClient`, the changes required should be smaller, if you are using `OpenFgaApi` a bit more changes will be needed.

You will have to modify some parts of your code, but we hope this will be to the better as a lot of the parameters are now correctly marked as required,
and so the Pointer-to-String conversion is no longer needed.

Some of the changes to expect:

- The following request interfaces changed:
  - `CheckRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `CheckRequestTupleKey`, you can also now pass in `Context`
  - `ExpandRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `ExpandRequestTupleKey`
  - `ReadRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `ReadRequestTupleKey`
  - `WriteRequest`: now takes `WriteRequestWrites` and `WriteRequestDeletes`, the latter of which accepts `TupleKeyWithoutCondition`
  - And more
- The following interfaces had fields that were optional are are now required:
  - `CreateStoreResponse`
  - `GetStoreResponse`
  - `ListStoresResponse`
  - `ListObjectsResponse`
  - `ReadChangesResponse`
  - `ReadResponse`
  - `AuthorizationModel`
  - And more
